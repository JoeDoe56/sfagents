/// The host's own mouse, made through the "MoonlightWeb Virtual HID" driver
/// on a Windows host with no pointing device (plan « souris HID virtuelle »,
/// option B, porte S1 chosen by Bruno on 19/10/2026).
///
/// ── Why a device ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
///
/// A Windows host with no mouse draws no pointer, and SendInput is not a
/// device: the pointer moves, nobody sees it, and a game that reads Raw Input
/// by device (hDevice) sees nothing at all. Mouse Keys (PointerPresence, the
/// fallback) make Windows show the pointer; a mouse makes it show the pointer
/// and gives games a device, whose relative moves, buttons and wheel arrive
/// as hardware input.
///
/// ── Why this descriptor and no other (S1) ───────────────────────────────────
///
/// The HID passthrough refuses every keyboard, mouse and system-control
/// collection, in the engine and again in the driver (hid::validate): a page
/// must never be able to make the host a pointing device out of network data.
/// That stays. The one exception is this descriptor, fixed here and compared
/// byte for byte by the driver: nothing a page sends can be it, since a page's
/// collections go through validate(), which refuses it, and the engine never
/// hands a page's bytes to the driver unchecked.
///
/// Pure: the bytes, their reports and the comparison, tested anywhere.
namespace mw::native::input::systemmouse {

/// One input report, no report id: buttons 1-5 (one bit each, three bits of
/// padding), X and Y relative on 16 bits, little-endian, the wheel and the
/// horizontal wheel (Consumer AC Pan) on 8 bits, all signed.
